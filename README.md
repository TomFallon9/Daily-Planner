## Description

I created a simple calendar that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The Moment.js library was used to work with date and time.



## View

## Usage
The top of the page shows the current date. When the user scrolls down to the timeblocks, the current hour is colored red, the past hours are colored gray, and the future hours are colored green. When the user types in the text area and presses the save button next to the text area, the text inside will be saved to the page and local browser.
